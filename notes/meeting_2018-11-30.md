# Notes from a Skype session November 30 2018

- we agreed to explore the new modeling approach and aim for a CogSci proceedings paper
- the general division of labor is that Greg helps most with the conceptual background and the
  grounding in the current literature; Michael will continue developing the code (see below)
  and Mihael will take over the code at some point to explore every bright and dark corner of
  the model
- extension to the model to be implemented/explored next:
	- different semantics:
		- optimal thresholds (from Qing & Franke 2014) for each feature dimension
		- maybe the clustering model from (Schmidt et al 2011)
	- different distribution for features:
		- try also "closed-scale" distributions (e.g., Beta or Gamma)
		- maybe in the future: a richer and more realistic environment (maybe features as
          distributed in the Tuna corpus so as to gear up for experiments?)
	- track exceptions, i.e., count the number of contexts where communicative success of
      'brown-tall' is higher than 'tall-brown'
	- track success in "uniquely-referring contexts", i.e., contexts in which there is only a
      single object that is both brown and tall
